1. In the below elements which of them are values or an expression? eg:- values can be integer or string and expressions will be mathematical operators.
Ans- 
'hello' is a expression
-87.8 - value
-  - expression 
/ - expression
+	- expression	
6  - value

2. What is the difference between string and variable?
A string is a sequence of one or more characters (letters, numbers, symbols) that can be either a constant or a variable.
Variables are symbols that you can use to store data in a program.

3. Describe three different data types.
There are three type of data types 
1. Int , 2. Boolean, 3. Float and 4. String.
4. What is an expression made up of? What do all expressions do?
Ans- A combination of operands and operators is called an expression. 
The +, -, and * operators for mathematical addition, subtraction, and multiplication are similar to other languages, but the behaviour of division differs. There are two types of divisions in Python: floor division (or integer division) // and floating-point/division.[93] Python uses the ** operator for exponentiation. We have many expressions as well.
5. This assignment statements, like spam = 10. What is the difference between an expression and a statement?
Ans- Expressions are unique in meaning, while statements are two-sided in execution and Statements are the whole structure. 
Spam = 10
Spam = 10 is a expression and 
The assignment statement (=) binds a name as a reference to a separate, dynamically-allocated object.
Here, Spamâ€™s values is 10.
        
6. After running the following code, what does the variable bacon contain?
bacon = 22
bacon + 1
Ans = 23
7. What should the values of the following two terms be?
'spam' + 'spamspam'
'spam' * 3
Ans- spamspamspam

8. Why is eggs a valid variable name while 100 is invalid?
Ans- Cause, 100 is a number and variable names cannot begin with a number.

9. What three functions can be used to get the integer, floating-point number, or string version of a value?
Ans- Use int() for integer value ,
Use float() for float value, and 
Use str() for string.

10. Why does this expression cause an error? How can you fix it?
'I have eaten ' + 99 + ' burritos.'
Ans- We cant concatenate or add in this above way we can simply right 'I have eaten ' + '99' + ' burritos.'
