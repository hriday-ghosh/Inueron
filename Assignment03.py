Assignment 03

1.	Why are functions advantageous to have in your programs?
Ans- Creating function very useful to our function, if we create function then it does not required to write code for a same logic again and again, we just simply call the function use as decorator.

2.	When does the code in a function run: when it's specified or when it's called?
Ans- The code in a function is executed when the function is called, not when it is specified.

3. What statement creates a function?
Ans- def statement helps to create a function.

4. What is the difference between a function and a function call?
Ans- function is couple of code which is executable when need and after calling. 
Function calling means, for executing the function properly, we need to call the function other wise it won’t run.

5. How many global scopes are there in a Python program? How many local scopes?
Ans- In a Python program, there is only one global scope.
The number of local scopes in a Python program depends on how many functions are called during   the program's execution. Each time a function is called, a new local scope is created for that function's variables and parameters.

6. What happens to variables in a local scope when the function call returns?
Ans- When a function call returns, the local scope of that function is ended, and any variables defined within that scope are deleted.

7. What is the concept of a return value? Is it possible to have a return value in an expression?
Ans- a return value is the value that a function or method sends back to the calling code after it has finished executing.
Yes, it is possible to have a return value in an expression in Python.

8. If a function does not have a return statement, what is the return value of a call to that function?
Ans - If a function does not have a return statement, the function will implicitly return “None”.

9. How do you make a function variable refer to the global variable?
Ans- By using global keyword to declare that the variable is a global variable.

10. What is the data type of None?
Ans: In Python, None is a built-in constant that represents the absence of a value.

11. What does the sentence import areallyourpetsnamederic do?
Ans: It is an invalid module.

12. If you had a bacon() feature in a spam module, what would you call it after importing spam?
Ans: I can import the spam module and call the bacon() function like this:
import spam  
spam.bacon()  

13. What can you do to save a programme from crashing if it encounters an error?
Ans: We can use exception handling
Like 
try:
  print(x)
except :
  print("Variable x is not defined")


14. What is the purpose of the try clause? What is the purpose of the except clause?
Purpose of the try and except clause handling exception. 
Like, if condition or code crashed in try block then exception block will be printed.
